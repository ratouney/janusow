> ### Overwatch Profile Stalker
> Stalk a profile, know what someone should and should not play
> Track your own stats accross multiple accounts

## Setup
To start the application, clone the repository and install the NodeJS modules using Yarn or Npm, then simply run the start-up script.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ratouney/janusow
$ cd janusow
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

This should open your browser at `localhost:3000` with a local version of the webapp.

For the app to work, you now need access to the corresponding API which is : <https://ow-api.com/docs/#stats>
<br>(this API runs a modified version of this docker image if you wish to run it yourself [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/sdwolfe32/ovrstat))
